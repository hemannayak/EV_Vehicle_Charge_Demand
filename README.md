## 🧰 Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Statsmodels**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Rich** (for terminal text styling)

## 📋 Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   Utilized a cleaned dataset: `preprocessed_ev_data.csv`.

2. **Forecasting Logic**  
   Applied linear regression to model EV growth over time per region.

3. **Interactive UI**  
   - Multiselect region dropdown with selection limit warning  
   - Year slider (1 to 5 years forecast)  
   - Key metric cards for growth percentage, current EVs, etc.

4. **Outputs**  
   - Forecast plots with historical + future trends  
   - Downloadable CSV of forecasts  
   - Styled Streamlit dashboard with sidebar info
